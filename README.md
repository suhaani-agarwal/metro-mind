# MetroMind 
## 🚇 Overview
MetroMind is an AI-powered intelligent depot management and scheduling system built for Kochi Metro.
It acts as the central brain for depot operations — autonomously optimizing train scheduling, maintenance planning, and resource allocation through advanced mathematical optimization and machine learning.
MetroMind transforms conventional human-dependent depot workflows into predictive, adaptive, and self-optimizing operations, ensuring efficiency, safety, and reliability across every daily cycle.

<!-- ## ✨ Key Features
- Virtual Depot Twin – Real-time digital replica of the entire depot built by aggregating sensor data, maintenance logs, and operational inputs.
- AI-Driven Optimization – Multi-objective scheduling using Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver for train readiness, maintenance, and parking arrangements.
- Predictive Intelligence – Machine learning models (LSTM, XGBoost, RandomForest) forecast failures, optimize departure sequences, and adapt to disruptions.
- Ad-Aware Scheduling – Integrates commercial campaigns into scheduling to maximize advertisement visibility and metro revenue.
- Interactive Dashboard – Next.js + Tailwind interface for real-time visualization, predictive heatmaps, and natural-language commands.
- Voice Command Interface – Speech-enabled assistant (OpenAI Whisper + Google TTS) supporting Malayalam and English.
- Failure Horizon AI – Predicts possible subsystem faults hours in advance, minimizing downtime and improving reliability.
- Human-in-the-Loop Learning – Learns from supervisor overrides to continuously refine scheduling intelligence.
